Drum Kit Web App
An interactive web app that lets you play virtual drums using your keyboard or mouse clicks.  
Each button represents a drum sound. Press the corresponding key or click the button to play!


Features
- Play sounds by clicking on drum buttons or pressing keys ('w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'j', 'k', 'l')
- Button animation when is pressed
- Simple and fun UI with responsive layout
- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript


How it works
- Each drum button has a class and a label ('w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'j', 'k', 'l')
- When a key is pressed or a button is clicked, a JavaScript event listener detects the input
- The makeSound() function plays a specific sound file depending on the pressed key
- The buttonAnimation() function briefly adds a '.pressed' class to create a visual effect

3. Play drums by pressing the keys 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'j', 'k', 'l' or by clicking the drums.
